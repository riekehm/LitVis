# LitVis

LitVis is a lightweight, Excel‑like application designed for managing literature research.  
It enables you to import and export CSV files, edit cells with rich‑text formatting (bold, italic, bullet lists, colors, etc.), apply conditional formatting, advanced filtering, and save/load projects (including column order, widths, and custom rules).

## Features

- **CSV Import/Export:**  
  Easily import and export CSV files using a custom delimiter (e.g. “;” for Excel compatibility).

- **Rich‑Text Editing:**  
  Edit cell content with formatting options such as bold, italic, bullet lists, font colors, and sizes.

- **Conditional Formatting:**  
  Highlight specific keywords in your cells based on user‑defined rules.

- **Advanced Filtering:**  
  Filter table data with multiple conditions. You can also filter “in any column” by selecting the “Any Column” option.

- **Project Saving/Loading:**  
  Save your current table (including column order, widths, and formatting rules) as a JSON project file and load it later.

- **Undo/Redo & Column Visibility Toggle:**  
  Easily undo changes and toggle column visibility through a dedicated dropdown menu.
